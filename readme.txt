How to setup

--first step getting kovaaks stats directory---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

. the default file path for your stats folder is all ready in cfg.txt but if you installed kovaaks in a different directory
. you will have to follow the next steps.

. open steam --> library --> right click on KovaaKs --> manage --> browse local files --> fps aim trainer --> stats

. once you have navigated to the stats folder copy the path at the top of file explorer.

. your path should look something like this --> C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FPSAimTrainer\FPSAimTrainer\stats

. then paste it into  cfg.txt
 
--second step : data grabber-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

. run the dataGrabber.exe and wait until the program grabs all of your kovaaks data.
. you know its done when the terminal says all your data has been collected.

. now every time you play a scenario the data will be appended to appropriate file.
. you will have to run the exe every single time you start KovaaKs, or you can put it in your startup files in which case it
. startup every time you turn your computer on 

. the way you find your start up folder is by --> windows key + r --> shell:startup --> then make a short cut of dataGrabber.exe
. and paste it into your startup folder

--Third Step : Plot Data-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

. plotData.exe only works once all of your data has been colleted 
. it also only works on the last Scenario you played
